<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">I am currently working on a modpack named <strong>Voyage of Odyssey - Conquest and
            Constructs</strong> that I plan to upload to Modrinth, and I would be honored to include your mod in it.
        However, I understand that your mod is protected under the "All Rights Reserved" designation, and distribution
        is not allowed without explicit permission from you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">With that in mind, I kindly request your permission to include your mod in my modpack
        and upload it onto Modrinth. I assure you that I will respect your intellectual property rights and comply with
        any specific requirements or restrictions you may have.</span></p>

        need further information, please do not hesitate to let me know. I look forward to your response.</span></p>
